NEED to spell out when we start buiding

Are we pre-assembling the encoders and the motors?

each kid can work on a magnet and motor

on the encoders we can leave it so we do NOT bend the hall effect leads into the plastic mounts


	install the RGB LEDs into the LED cable
		Do NOT put an LED into the connector on the short end of the cable
		Insert the RGB LED into the LED Mount (the top hat 3D print)
		Install the LEDs into the cable connectors, so that the LONG lead is inserted into the Black box on the connector
			NOTE: fanning out the leads slightly make insertion into the connector easier
	Route the LED cable into the chassis
		Start with the short end of the cable in the center back of the chassis and route cable clockwise
	install the RGB LEDs into the mounts in the chassis corners	

challenge is with the top chassis to the bottom and motor mounts

route wires last through the square opening not the oval openings

	LED Cable connector
	insert a black wire into black hole on the connector
	insert a red wire into the hole next to the black wire...the 2 center holes will now have a wire
	insert the third wire next to the red wire...there will be an open hole in the connector next to the black wire

	Encoder Cable connector
	insert a black wire into the connector match it up to the existing black wire
	insert a red wire into the connector match it up to the existing red wire
	insert a white wire into the connector match it up to the existing white wire

NOW add the mainboard mount
